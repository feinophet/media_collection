# media_collection
the purpose of this repo is to gather information about the top listed articles and correlate that with global news. the goal is to corrolate mass media consumption (what is taking the attention of the majority of the global population) with what is going on in the world. Examples of this would be: is there any correlation as to why TikTok dances are gaining so much attention while there is a war going on in Ukraine? why are there other events being brought to social media that are less concerning than other events that happen on the regular?
